# MiniGolf
A minigolf game I created to improve my understanding of c++ and libraries , linkers 

Hugely inspired by PolyMars's [TwiniGolf](https://github.com/PolyMarsDev/Twini-Golf) (The Game physics are basically the same and just redrew his textures in inkscape)

# Building
Open with Visual Studio and add the include and lib files for SDL2,SDL2_image,SDL2_ttf ([SDL](https://github.com/libsdl-org)) to a folder called SDL2 in the root directory ([you can use the sdl2.zip file here](https://github.com/luqmaan-k/MiniGolf/releases/tag/V1))
